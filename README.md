# Tax Calculator Application in React

# Project Overview

I've have developed a tax calculator application using React that enables users to input various financial details and obtain projected financial results based on these inputs. The application is designed to be user-friendly, providing real-time updates and results.

# Key Features

1. User Input Handling:
   - The application allows users to enter their financial details, including initial investment, annual investment, expected return rate, and investment duration.
   - These inputs are captured through the `UserInput` component, which consists of input fields for each financial parameter.

2. State Management:
   - The `useState` hook is used to manage the state of the user inputs. 
   - The initial state is set with default values for initial investment, annual investment, expected return rate, and duration to ensure the application starts with a complete dataset.

3. Dynamic State Updates:
   - A function `handleChange` is implemented to handle changes in user inputs. 
   - This function updates the state dynamically by taking the input identifier and the new value, ensuring that only the relevant part of the state is updated without affecting the rest.

4. Real-time Results Display:
   - The `Results` component receives the current user inputs as props and calculates the projected financial outcomes.
   - It displays the results instantly, providing users with immediate feedback based on their input data.

5. Component Structure:
   - The application is structured into three main components: `Header`, `UserInput`, and `Results`.
   - The `Header` component displays the title or main heading of the application.
   - The `UserInput` component is responsible for capturing and updating the user's financial inputs.
   - The `Results` component processes the input data and displays the calculated projections.

# Technical Implementation

- React Hooks: Utilizes `useState` for managing component state.
- Props: Passes user input data between components using props.
- Dynamic Updates: Ensures real-time calculation and display of results based on user input.

# Conclusion

This project effectively demonstrates your ability to build a dynamic, user-interactive application using React. It highlights your skills in managing component state, handling user inputs, and creating a responsive UI that updates in real-time based on user interactions.
