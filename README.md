# Tax-Calculator-Using-React
Developed a React-based tax calculator application that allows users to input financial details (initial investment, annual investment, expected return, duration) and view projected outcomes. Utilized useState for state management, and components (Header, UserInput, Results) to handle inputs and display real-time results dynamically.
